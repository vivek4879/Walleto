To understand the technologies of application development used in today's world, I worked on this project with a friend to develop an e-wallet application linked to a bank account that allows a user to make transactions, pay bills and receive cashbacks named Walleto. The application uses Angular in Frontend and Springboot in backend. For this project it was intuitive to go ahead with Java as the choice of programming language with Springboot for backend, HTML, CSS along with Angular for Frontend ,Oracle as the database, Git for collaboration and version check and further Maven and Jenkins for packaging the product and getting it market ready. To get a hang of production code, I also implemented Test Driven Development (TDD) using suites such as Mockito, junit and PMD.
